# 💻 About this project

This application is made for a thesis project that investigates sustainability in software engineering and cloud products. I wrote this project during my internship at Microsoft. In my thesis, I use this project as a case study to investigate how we can improve sustainability by investigating and optimizing its domain through its economic, societal, technical, and environmental dimensions.

# 👩‍🎓 Background
Cloud-based applications offer a variety of opportunities for scalability, flexibility, and efficiency. However, they are also known for using a lot of energy. This research explores the various opportunities for building a sustainable cloud-based application through the development of a web application. The web application WanderMate is an intelligent travel itinerary generator that generates a personalized sustainable trip. This application is a cloud-based application that utilizes Microsoft Azure’s cloud services with the aim to understand and optimize the efficiency and sustainability in cloud-based architectures.
